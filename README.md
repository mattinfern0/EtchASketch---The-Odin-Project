# Etch A Sketch -The Odin Project
Basic Etch A Sketch Clone using JS

My implementation of the [EtchASketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) from the The Odin Project.

Uses Javascript to generate/resize the drawing grid and allow the user to "draw" on the grid
